So in case you guys are wondering why your Skyrim won't launch it's cause Bethesda decided to push out an unannounced nothing update that just adds an extra option in the main menu and some fixes for foreign versions of the game, essentially fucking up everyone's mods. Anyway I saw this fix in the comments on the [r/skyrimmods](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/) subreddit so big thanks to [u/ContraBiscuits](https://www.reddit.com/u/ContraBiscuits/) for this fix I/m essentially just copy pasting his fix on here in order to spread awareness.

Anyone that wants to downgrade back to AE from a few hours ago (1.6.353):

First type this into your web browser:

> steam://nav/console

Then allow it to open steam client bootstrapper. Once the console window appears, type:

> download\_depot 489830 489833 4570833277049890269

Check the console for the location of the newly downloaded skyrimse.exe version 1.6.353. Then simply replace the exe in your game files with this one. Don't know how well this will work but the game is at least launching for me so...

Edit: Should probably mention that I assume this only works for Skyrim Special Edition on Steam.

Hope this helps you guys out, I tried this fix for myself and everything seems to be working fine.
