# exa · a modern replacement for ls

## Excerpt
> No — exa has, in my opinion, much saner defaults than ls, so while the available command-line options are similar, they are not exactly the same. Most of the common options will work consistently, though. For example, exa prints human-readable file sizes by default, so the -h option no longer applies.

### Is this a drop-in replacement for `ls`?

No — exa has, in my opinion, much saner defaults than `ls`, so while the available command-line options are similar, they are not **exactly** the same. Most of the common options will work consistently, though. For example, exa prints [human-readable file sizes](https://the.exa.website/features/long-view#sizes) by default, so the `-h` option no longer applies.

### Why would I want Git in my file listing anyway?

Because you get to see the Git information alongside everything else. Yes, it’s already trivial to just run `git status` when you’re in your shell. But when you need to double-check exactly which files have been staged, you **really** need to see it clearly!

### Windows support?

Very soon now. It is looking highly likely that the current version of exa (v0.10.0) will be the last without Windows support.

### What licence does exa use?

It uses the [MIT licence](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/ "The permissions of the MIT licence"). The code is open-source — development happens [over on GitHub](https://github.com/ogham/exa "exa on GitHub"), and [contributions are gratefully accepted](https://the.exa.website/contributing)!
