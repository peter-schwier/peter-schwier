##### Powerful Versatile Silly Little Guy

I love my little guy. I'm not very mechanically inclined (I fought for my life to build my own PC), but this bad boy came together in like, less than an hour! My only mishap was my butter fingers losing a standoff, but Mr Allen so graciously had a replacement sent over to me!! (Many thanks again <3)

He's really beautiful! The lighting is gorgeous, and the screen is just the right size for me. The screen is really a highlight, honestly - I have tried mapping shortcuts into layers on my keyboard, but I have -5 memory and never remember what function I mapped where. The screen truly is my holy savior because I don't have to remember anymore... Also it's cute and it makes me feel stylish. Being able to plug it in and go and switch between profiles... truly what I consider Functional (TM).

duckyScript is also fantastic! I am a decent programmer, but one certainly need not be to understand how to configure their own keys - I personally find it very intuitive, and is great for beginners and power users alike!

I cannot recommend this little guy enough! If you're looking into a macropad, this guy for sure needs to be on the list!

##### INCREDIBLE

Such an amazing product, the seller has been more than willing to go above and beyond to deliver, I'm in Mexico and it arrived a few weeks after shipping, the quality is amazing and community is awesome, looking forward to learn from this and play a bunch with my new duckyPad

Jeroen | March 6, 2023

##### Very nice tool to improve your productivity.

Since Royal Mail was under attack it was a struggle to get my package to arrive in Belgium. I got great support from dekuNukem, he really helped me to get it delivered.

At this moment, I am playing with this tool, it is a great enhancement for your productivity, and the extra software tools provided are a very nice welcome and make it very easy to get everything configured.

Many kudos and thanks to dekuNukem to create such a wonderful piece of software and hardware.

Robert | Feb. 20, 2023

##### Beautiful, Highly Customizable Macro Pad

This device is beautiful and highly functional. I love it! I'm using it for my everyday programming needs.

The one drawback was the shipping, but I chose the cheapest option during a busy time, so it should have been expected. But the seller was very communicative and apologetic about it and even warned me before hand that shipping could be spotty, so I can't really be upset. The only thing I would recommend is that if you want this sooner, pay for the expedited shipping. Otherwise the shipping time could end up being longer than expected.

In other words, everything that the seller could control was fantastic.

Riu | Jan. 24, 2023

##### A overdue review for an immensely useful product.

The DuckyPad has been a great help in maintaining my workflow with my new Cinitq (which lacked any usable buttons), it was easy to put together for someone who has never dealt with DIY keyboards before and I was provided with clear, polite and efficient support for an questions that I had.

A wonderful product.

Mitch | Dec. 19, 2022

##### Great Product with Excellent Support

The kit arrived in about 2 weeks (to US) as indicated and was very easy to assemble. After reading other reviews, I ordered the metal plates which are very stable. I also ordered the keycaps here but added my preferred switches (Cherry MX blue). The docs are very thorough and the software works well. I was getting a few software errors and the maker replied very quickly with solutions. (Problems turned out to be caused by the microSD card and reformatting did the trick.) The profiles are stored in a simple plain text format and every time you make a change it also backs up to the system drive. (After reformatting the microSD, simply dragging the last backup to the card restored everything.) The screen and keylights are nice and bright and the scripting is robust enough to do complex multistep functions. The screen really sets this apart from competitors -- very handy to see directly what each key is set to do. After just a few days, it is amazing how many uses there are for the device. This is a great product that is very well thought out and designed. Highly recommended!

Flavio | Oct. 2, 2022

##### excellent

Excellent hardware, very fast shipping, product arrived in the EU within a week and no duty in spite of Brexit.

There is not a single other macro keyboard or macropad with the same capabilities. I really don't understand why nobody manufactures anything similar.

Very useful for office work when having to work on different computers and repeating text. Text can be saved on a memory card and then reentered, saves time wasted for copy-paste.

Frandu Ii | Sept. 20, 2022

##### Well built and very useful utility wise

Ordered a DuckyPad and was surprised with how useful it is with my workflow. The Duckypad is physically well built and compact enough to fit in my busy table without getting in the way. It is well documented with its user friendly documentation on git and it is also fairly simple to build with ease.

Overall The Duckypad is insanely well developed, am impressed with its capabilities fit into its small form factor.

Martin | June 17, 2022

##### Duckypad is an awesome product and very well built

Ordered a duckypad from this seller. I'm seriously surprised on the quality of the physical product and the software. So much, that I had to order another one. I love the features of a duckyscript programmable keypad. The model I've ordered is the one with aluminium plates and it's very professionally done.

Julian | Feb. 28, 2022

##### excellent, beautiful and useful

The only bad thing was the 2 week wait, but it was worth the wait. It works perfect, it looks just like it is in the photos. I've been playing with it for a while to take advantage of it

Ryan | Feb. 26, 2022

##### Quality product sold by a quality seller

The duckypad is just the programmable macropad that I have been looking for. It is high quality all around. The parts themselves are sturdy and come together to form an aesthetically pleasing device. The seller is also wonderful and accommodating as they held the shipment during the holidays as I was traveling and wasn't able to receive it.

Kevin | Jan. 18, 2022

##### Excellent Macro Pad, Thorough Documentation, Simple Assembly

I was impressed by the design and flexibility of this little board but was blown away at the quality of documentation and support applications. You can tell that the designer of this suite of hardware and software love what they do and use the product themselves. Hands down one of my favorite purchases of the year.

I initially bought one for work and another for home, but am now considering buying one more to double the buttons and another still to gift to a friend. Having both the Aluminum and the Acrylic, I'd say that the Aluminum is definitely worth the extra $19USD. The additional weight helps it stay put and the rigidity does a better job of keeping the keys at a consistent height on the front panel, plus it looks sharp as hell.

I ordered from the US. Item ships from the UK. My shipment from the British Royal Mail took almost a month. This wasn't the seller's fault, just be aware that there are backups in shipping that may delay its arrival, but let me assure you, it is 100% worth the wait.

STRING Thank you, dekuNukem!

Bastiaan | Jan. 2, 2022

##### Super awesome product

The DuckyPad is a super awesome well developed product. Shipping to The Netherlands was a disaster tho because of our Customs that not letting me know that the package was in the country. But the sender sended it back again with a track and trace so I could track, all by all an amazing super service from the seller.

Rebecca | Dec. 16, 2021

##### Easily the best tech purchase I've ever made

My duckyPad arrived yesterday and right out of the box I was able to follow the instructions and assemble it in around an hour (which was actually quite fun). It took one more hour to quickly read up on Duckyscript and make some new profiles for my most used keyboard combinations. That means 2 hours later I have a working Macropad that is not only gorgeous (the lights are seriously beautiful!) but I can quickly adapt it to anything I am doing. I can already see how this device will be incredibly time saving for me, especially when it comes to using CAAD software but also drawing in Vector programs or using Magicavoxel.

Thank you so much for making this project and for making it accessible to people like me who aren't coders or tech heads but nonetheless needed a customizable solution to improve their workflow! Highly recommend.

Adam | Dec. 7, 2021

##### Fantastic!

Received my duckyPad today. It was easy to assemble and so far it's been a joy to use. Will spend some time tweaking / customizing the macros, but overall I'm so happy with it! Also, would like to mention that the seller's communication was timely and quite helpful. The assembly documentation was clearly written and had plenty of reference photos. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a macropad/10-key who has too many shortcuts to efficiently/consistently deploy day to day. Only wish is that the display were bigger, but considering noone else offers a hotkey / numpad with a display, I guess I can't really complain! (take my last sentence / statement as a future upgrade consideration for duckyPad 2.0.

Spencer | Nov. 17, 2021

##### Good macro pad with easy assembly

Highly customizable and easy to assemble. Arrived quickly despite international shipping! Definitely recommended.

Simon | Nov. 8, 2021

##### Loving it!

Look, I didn't need one. You don't need one. But you want one, so treat yourself. It's pretty, and it works very well.

Lachlan | Nov. 1, 2021

##### Very customizable and great productivity tool

This has been a great helper for apps that have many keyboard short cuts that are hard to remember, or are slightly more complicated to type. e.g. It is very handy to have a single key for all my commonly used tmux commands on any computer just by plugging it in.

The kit was very easy to assemble. I used a bunch of leftover switches from a switch tester.

Highly recommended!

Dylan | Oct. 30, 2021

##### For someone's home project, this thing is awesome.

I have been looking for a micro macro pad for playing Eve Online and really any other mmo where there is 1,000,000 button combinations and well, this lays it all out and if you forget your button THERE'S A SCREEN YO. Hands down a great purchase. The discord is alive and active.

Alaric | Oct. 27, 2021

##### This thing's brilliant

The configurability and versatility of this macropad is fantastic. I've set mine up to do a bunch of things that are otherwise complicated chords, and are now just single presses for me. Also, as I have a dual PC setup with a KVM switch, I've attached the duckypad to my main computer - so if I'm switched over to the second one I can still press the duckypad keys to control my music playing from the main computer without needing to trigger the KVM switch, which is handy :-)

Randy | Oct. 25, 2021

##### Amazing product

I'm in love with the duckyPad; it feels great to use, it sounds satisfying and its functionality is through the roof. I also received a really good customer support; can only recommend buying.

Richard | Oct. 23, 2021

##### Great design, easy to assemble, one switch disappointed

The duckyPad is a great design, easy to assemble, and arrived fast. Getting the Gateron Green switches safely inserted and operational presented a bit of a challenge. I had to reseat about a third of the switches, and reached success with all-but-one (which appears to have been a bit flawed from the start: one pin is too short or perhaps retracted into the switch housing.)

I can't fault the developer/seller for a problem with that switch. I found it difficult to get another Gateron Green, in less that a month, so I've ordered some Cherry switches which are similarly suitable for backlighting... (blue ones, in fact, because their I clickiness.) No regrets.

James | Oct. 21, 2021

##### Wonderful product, simple and yet insanely powerful!

Using is for macro-control, the modular look is excellent, and the programmability is where this thing shines. Looking to create in-depth macros for programs? Go nuts! I love its simple but functional design, and it wows all my tech-savvy friends! Love it, would buy it again!

Miko | Oct. 7, 2021

##### Simple and powerful!

For anyone familiar with putting a mechanical keyboard together, this should be an easy assembly. Instructions werer thorough, everything that was needed was included, and programming was intuitive and stress-free through the duckyPad Configurator app. Great job to the dev. This thing is extremely versatile and an awesome addition to any battlestation. 10/10 would recommend.

Jd | Oct. 5, 2021

##### The best purchase I have made on this site

I bought this product a while ago, and have been incredibly impressed with not only the build quality, but the community, the software/firmware, and the responsiveness of the seller. I have had a couple issues with it (all unrelated to the actual product), and when I contact the seller I get a response very quickly with extremely helpful suggestions to make it work. This product, by nature, but also specifically the product is extremely versatile, I use it for gaming, working, school, and regular browsing and communicating. It has become a natural extension of my own keyboard. My product came with some preloaded key configurations and for a lot of them I have yet to change them they are intuitively helpful. The programming of this keypad is remarkably easy, in part due to duckyscript, but the software used to program the keystrokes is super easy to understand and use. The documentation to update firmware or reflash the SD card is also incredibly in depth and helpful. I really cant recommend this product enough, if you think you would have any use for this product at all then it will certainly be worth it.

Thijs | Sept. 13, 2021

##### Overall a great buy worth every penny!

Awesome little macro pad, really a do-it-all-macropad. Great documentation on the build and setup, even for a novice like me easy to understand and build! My only (minor) complaint is that their isn't a case included to enclose the macropad, so the front- and backplate with the pcb are quite exposed and im finding it risky to take it with me since im afraid i might damage it.

Someone on the internet solved this complaint with a great 3D printable case (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4688721) and that solved all of my complaints :) Big thanks to the creator, Allen, great product! Would certainly recommend it to everyone, my friend has also bought one on my recommendation, after experiencing it himself.

Matthew | Sept. 13, 2021

##### Wonderful product!

Process of ordering was easy, product shipped next business day, seller was easy to contact via Discord. Documentation is detailed and thorough. Royal post provided tracking updates up until it left the source country. Canada Post dropped the ball though and still doesn't think they've ever had it even though they've delivered it. Packaging was great as well. I have Zero complaints thus far.

Sebastien | Sept. 8, 2021

##### Fantastic product

Works like a charm and the possibility to update a text file on a simple microsd.  
Configured to use with Blender under GNU/Linux but I can also see some use for videogame macros too :)

Margot | Aug. 31, 2021

##### more useful than I thought it would be

I've had this for a few months now and have found it really useful and fun. Originally thought I'd just use it for shortcuts in image / audio editing programs but have been using it with games where there's some specific, repetitive menu navigation. Really enjoy figuring out different applications for it...duckyScript is pretty fun. Assembly was easy and clear too.

Benjamin | July 30, 2021

##### Awesome extension keyboard

I'm very pleased with the duckyPad, with the options it gives you, it is the perfect macropad for me.  
Building it, setting it up, and configuring it was very easy and straight forward.  
Thank you!

Tomasz | June 25, 2021

##### Brilliant

I’ve been using it for the past few weeks and it’s brilliant. Great use of RGB backlighting and the tiny screen makes an already awesome thing even better. I also like the way the programming is done - as much as I enjoy building custom layouts for TMK/QMK, the companion software gets the job done very well.

James | June 21, 2021

##### I love it and I use it every day.

Two new gadgets were presented at the famous 1968 "mother of all demos". https://youtu.be/yJDv-zdhzMY?t=1884 One, on the right, was the first mouse, the other on the left was a context-sensitive shorthand keyboard. The duckyPad is the realisation of that second device. Incredibly useful if you combine it with the auto switcher app.

I only have two gripes.

1) Despite being awake (lit), it sometimes needs a keypress to wake it up.  
2) Sometimes it does not go to sleep at all. walk past my office door late at night, PC screen has gone to sleep but the duckyPad is on and is lighting up the whole room.

Thomas | June 16, 2021

##### Really well done

I was able to put together the duckyPad in a half hour or so. It worked right away on my Windows laptop, Pixelbook and linux desktop. Bought one for my son - he is using it as a MIDI controller. The documentation was very clear. The unit was easy to snap together. I am going to try some simple scripts next. Maybe connect it to a RPi and use it to help control my office lights.

Marco | June 14, 2021

##### Ducky pad

Great product constant update great discord channel! I suggest to print a 3d case … Very happy whit !

Josh | June 8, 2021

##### A fun and practical computer toy

Assembly was fun and easy, I accidentally bent a switch pin but it was otherwise straightforward. The latest beta software (as of 8/6/21) with the ability to update the scripts without removing the SD card is really nice. Like a child with a hammer everything becomes a nail, but in this case the nails are things I type all the time, application toggles, and useful scripts for work.

Richard | June 8, 2021

##### Great product & service

It's a great product, and great, friendly service.

I spent a fun weekend automating things with Duckyscript, and found some great use cases - but the nicest is having a physical button to pop-up a terminal and ssh into a specific AWS server... and then have the duckyPad auto-switch to another profile with appropriate DevOps scripts immediately available. Which means I can use a vanilla OS install, and still have my tools available straight away, without futzing with shell profiles. And then, I can stick it in my bag, and run the same scripts from whichever machine I'm working from. Just brilliant!

Andrei | June 7, 2021

##### Brilliant little kit from a passionate engineer

I always wanted to play around with with building my own macro keyboard but could never justify the time. This little brilliant kit was the perfect solution to scratch that tinkering itch. I really appreciated the fact that the whole project is open source and the "no-bullshit" approach of the maker. The community on Discord is also really lovely.

Christian | June 6, 2021

##### wouldnt know

Fasteners/standoffs didnt come with packaging, so there is no way for me to assemble the product. I sent a message to the seller but I'm still waiting a response

![Avatar][fig2]

##### Response from dekuNukem | June 6, 2021

Hi Christian:

Sorry to hear about the missing fasteners, I have sent you a message about arranging the replacements for free, so please take a look. Thanks.

Best Regards,

Allen

Christian | June 3, 2021

##### amazing macropad with awesome switches

The duckypad is a dream come true. i use it at work to automate simple processes on the work computer. this works without software on this pc. plug and play. the processing is incredible. the enclosed software allows programming in next to no time.

Todd | June 1, 2021

##### Awesome experience!

The macro pad was shipped fast. I am amazed with the detailed documentation for this product. The macro pad can be programmed by hand or with an app. I was able to assemble the pre-soldered kit in less than 30 mins with the instructions online. Great job!

Dae-Young | May 25, 2021

##### Great macropad!

I ordered aluminium case version with a blank key cap. It's beautiful yet functional. One thing that I am worried about is that the display does not have protection plate, but it looks okay.

Robert | May 24, 2021

##### Freaking awesome!

DuckyPad is well built. Very well build. All solder points are spot on, acrylic plates are perfect. The instructions are clear and the community is always helpful. I can not gush enough about this. It has helped speed up my work flow immensely.

Thank you!

Jordan | May 24, 2021

##### I love my duckypad

I have been searching for a macro board for a while and chose this one. It is fully customizable and with the new auto profile switcher this thing is amazing. When a different program is the active window the duckypad will change profile to match. The docs are great and I was able to get help on the duckypad discord through some discussion. Cannot recommend this enough. I am a developer and have profiles for SSMS, vsCode, Visual Studio, Windows Terminal etc. The terminal one is helpful because it can open a win terminal, create multiple panes and change directories to working folders all with one button and I have the default for multiple projects. I suggest setting up a git repo to track your profiles and settings. Have fun

Pedro | May 12, 2021

##### Nice Pad

I love the options that this pad offers, only downside is if you want to do an WASD keyboard to play, it not works very well ( tryed on league of legends)  
Otherwise the support was great, 1st package got lost and they send me one tracked to ensure the delevery ( got it like 5 hours ago) bought april 03.

Hope that the updates fix those minor issues, keep things going, because it sems like great product for home and for work :)

1 big downside it's that Symantec antivirus keeps deleting the configurator file...  
I tryed the new one and he looks like corrupt

Marcos | May 10, 2021

##### Excellent macro keyboard

Excellent macro keyboard. It was a pleasure the assembly and the customization. I like the general feeling of the device. The keys keep very well attached to the pad, the keycaps with the colors look amazing.  
The only flaw I can tell is that the ribbon which connects the device with the screen looks like it can be broken easily, because it has no protection.

Carlos | May 4, 2021

##### Amazing little macropad

Really good macro pad with simple and easy to understand instructions, has a lot of potential to help with work flow and streaming especially if you have been considering buying something like a stream deck

Philip | April 21, 2021

##### Well made, well designed, masterful execution

I was late to the crowdfunding party, and eagerly awaited this project on Tindie. I was amazed by the display of the item, the execution, and its capability and cost. I could build something myself at a much larger cost, and fumble the execution. This checked all my boxes and with polish.

I was really excited that DekuNukem refined the product, continues to improve it, and put it together so well. I appreciate the fast shipping and overall user experience. I'm still trying to learn how to get the most mileage out of this macropad.

Thanks DekuNukem!

Caleb | April 21, 2021

##### Absolutely wonderful in all regards

I was looking to build a macropad for my girlfriend as a birthday gift. She's a graphic designer, so you can imagine how helpful it could be for her. I couldn't find any build kits until I found the duckyPad. I am so happy I bought it. The think is incredible, and DekuNukem is an amazing guy. The Discord server is very active and will answer any questions you might have. 10/10 recommend

James | April 13, 2021

##### Nice macro-pad.

It is a nice macropad. The lights and screen show you which set of macros are active.  
I ended up writing a bit of python to make programming it with duckyscript a bit nicer.

The docs warn you to check that the pins are straight when installing the keys.  
Definitely do that - if the the keys dont pop in easily, check the pins again.

August | April 12, 2021

##### it just works, perfectly

I had been looking for a macropad for a very long time, and then I found this product, (the duckyPad). I bought the full package (keyboard, switches, keycaps, usb-c cable) and when it arrived, I assembled it in like 10 minutes thanks to great documentation. It's also very easy to make macros, and now I'm saving a lot of time, because what used to be 5 separate key presses, now is 1 key press on the duckyPad. It's also fairly easy to update the firmware (it worked on the first try, thanks to great documentation again).

And while the keyboard itself has a very open design, it's easy to handle and move it around. But I think it would be really neat if you could buy a case for it (maybe even a protective case so you could put it in your backpack safely).

This thing is working so great, that I might just buy another one for my other devices!

Christian | April 12, 2021

##### Great Macropad

I really like it.  
It was easy to build, and also to set up with the documentation.  
I use it at home with apps, browsing, controlling videos, etc.  
Durring the pandemic i can't always sit at my desk, on those days i like to bring in a 60% mech so this macro pad is a perfect companion.

Jon | April 10, 2021

##### Probably the best macropad!

It's an amazing keyboard, you can have lots of macros and there is always space for more.  
The green switches and the 32 profiles are a big win, but the app for win/macOS is the icing on the cake. Totally recommended.  
The only thing I would change are the two buttons below the display, they are bit tiny for my fat fingers :)

Miguel | April 9, 2021

##### Friggin Great

I bought this for my wife, who wanted to help automate her use of her iPad Pro. She uses ClipStudio and a few other programs that have key shortcuts that were difficult to multitask while drawing and keeping most of her desk surface open. She found the documentation very easy to read and build, and had her workflow revolutionized in less than 30 minutes total. On my side (purchasing/shipping + communication with the seller), I had a great experience as well; Allen kept me informed of everything.

Would 100% recommend!

Johannes | April 9, 2021

##### The macro pad I was looking for, ticks all the boxes

\- Does NOT need any software to run. Most other macro pads use specific and most of the time Windows-only software, which you have to install, not possible on some servers. If push comes to shove, you can change the key settings with notepad/vim  
\- Easy to use and learn but still powerful DuckyScript  
\- Most valuable functionality: You can determine how FAST the pad types the text, very important for chained RDP connections where too fast typing swallows characters  
\- Useful and good looking per-key RGB backlighting, for example, to differentiate between normal (green) and elevated (red) login credentials  
\- The OLED screen quickly reminds me what key does what (really ingenious, hope for a bigger one on version 2.0 :), this is a stand-out feature)  
\- Love that I can set the sleep mode in minutes (and that it actually has one, 10 points!)  
\- Actively developed by the maker, just got another FW update, and an update for the very good and small (portable, no install necessary, multi OS) key setting utility  
\- And, let us not forget, half the price of other, less versatile commercial macro pads out there  
This is one of these rare devices, where one hopes it does one thing, and that very well, and it turns out it really, truly does AND more!  
10/10 would buy again in a heartbeat  
Honestly, using this now in production for work for about 3 weeks and am one happy camper, can not imagine being w/o

Eric | April 9, 2021

##### Good product

This product is a good DIY product, and works a charm for very repetitive tasks demanding combos of keystrokes.  
plus the color idea is great addition. good look  
thanks

Sebastian | April 8, 2021

##### Great Macropad with endless use cases

I use it for changing status in MS teams, inserting text and code snippets, volume control or for quick access to a lot of functions. Use cases are endless as you can do everything you can do with a keyboard, but at a single key press.  
The duckyPad script language is really easy and quiet powerful. The companion app makes editing of the profiles and scripts even easier. Deku is still active doing some bug fixes or adding some features, which is great!  
Shipping to germany took about 4 days and it came well packed.

##### Great macropad

I was hesitant to purchase the device but once I assembled it and fiddle with it I can say is amazing. Clear documentación and simple assembly.

I will buy another one, it will be a great gift.

##### The best macro pad possible

I love this thing. I was in on the original Kickstarter and then I loved it so much I came here to buy another one for work. I've got several pages of scripts and every few days I add some more scripts. I'm decent at writing scripts but something about having them so easily accessible makes me write things I wouldn't have wanted to learn increasingly complex key combinations to do. The display is perfect. This whole thing is absolutely perfect.

##### Excellent

I'm in a frontline IT role and I end up running the same sets of commands frequently this makes things so much easier and more consistent.

I would love to be able to access the SD card from the device since I have one of the files I need to update daily but that is a minor inconvenience for the benefit it gives me with all the other tasks I do regularly. Ideally being able to hold a key or multiple while plugging in that would allow the SD to show up, do the edits, eject, reset, good for the day.

Overall it is a fantastic and useful product that I wish I had found sooner.

##### Excellent Macropad

The Duckypad is a do-it-all(almost) macro pad. The ease of use and documentation right from assembling it to the configuration is all very well laid out. The only thing it lacks in my opinion is a rotary encoder and Bluetooth mode, otherwise it's a perfect macro pad for most of the requirement one might have. The software could benefit from a plugged-in mode which would reduce the hassle of removing and plugging the microSD card every time you want to configure something and an option to record keystrokes as macros will be great. The shipping was a slow affair, mostly due to the local postal authorities. The packaging could also be improved as my package was almost shredded by the time it reached me but for the price, this one is a steal and I would highly recommend it.

##### Everything I hoped for

Great product, simple to put together, beautiful. Configuration is easy, the software provided works well and making it your own is a breeze.

##### Incredible level of customization

I am amazed at how versatile the duckyPad is. With the duckyPad configurator and duckyScript, the possibilities seem endless! The instructions are top notch, and the hardware was super easy to put together. I'm not a hardware guy and I was able to put this together and have it working in 40 minutes.

THANK YOU for including Dvorak keyboard layout support!

I sent a few questions to the seller and he got back to me incredibly quick. Sir, I will buy anything you make. Customer for life.

##### Swiss Army Knive

I was looking for a tool that I could use to relieve my fingers and this keyboard does just that. In addition, the design is tidy and well-thought-out. Plus it is an Eye catcher with the lights in different colors. The switches are exact and responsive like it should be. The documentation is excellent, a furniture manufacturer from Sweden should take an example from it (^^). I also had a lot of fun assembling it. The Config is easy I think everybody is able to handle it you don't need to be a programmer. I am really happy with it.

Useful as helping hand for Parents:  
You can drive your kids crazy with it  
\- Go do your homework!  
\- Have you brushed your teeth yet?  
\- Your internet connection will be blocked in 3, 2, 1 ...

##### All round great little macro pad!

Wonderful little pad with a screen so I can easily see what profile I'm on and see what key does what, easy to put together too! Shipping was quick (UK) and came well packaged with lots of bubble wrap around the board. Software to make changes or make new macros is really simple to use, has lots of documentation to help if you get stuck and also the Discord server is really handy with lots of people helping each other out. Best macro board I've used yet!

##### Great little keypad!

Very pleased with the duckyPad, it arrived within a couple of days (UK) with no issues. It's very easily assembled (the hardest part was getting the protective cover off the acrylic pieces) and well supported with documentation on set up and use, plus the configurator app is a nice touch too.
