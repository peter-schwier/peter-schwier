📚

A **personal library** is an online [collection](https://indieweb.org/collection "collection") of [books](https://indieweb.org/book "book") and other media that reflects either physical or digital items one owns, wants to [acquire](https://indieweb.org/acquisition "acquisition"), has [bookmarked](https://indieweb.org/bookmark "bookmark") to [read](https://indieweb.org/read "read")/[watch](https://indieweb.org/watch "watch")/[listen](https://indieweb.org/listen "listen") to, is currently doing so, or has in the past.

For pages about [read](https://indieweb.org/read "read") posts or [books](https://indieweb.org/book "book") distributed or readable online, please see those pages and examples.

There is also a broader notion of a [library of things](https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=library_of_things&action=edit&redlink=1 "library of things (page does not exist)") which include tools and other useful objects that individuals loan to others for temporary use and return, however there are no known IndieWeb examples of that yet.

## How to

(this section is a stub)

How to maintain a personal library:

There aren’t any required practices, however, sometimes a personal library is maintained as an [archive](https://indieweb.org/archive "archive"), or [collections](https://indieweb.org/collection "collection") on individual [page](https://indieweb.org/page "page")(s).

The result: highlights.sawyerh.com

## Brainstorming

### How to mark up

-   Thoughts?

-   Maintaining [DRY](https://indieweb.org/DRY "DRY") principles with relation to [read](https://indieweb.org/read "read"), [bookmark](https://indieweb.org/bookmark "bookmark"), [acquisition](https://indieweb.org/acquisition "acquisition") and other similar posts.

### Reading list

Is there anything special about keeping a reading list beyond what you have in your personal library? E.g.

-   items in your personal library you want to (re)read
-   items you want to (temporarily) acquire to read
    -   borrow from a friend
    -   checkout from a public library

#### Notes from Jacky

 ![](https://jacky.wtf/assets/favicon.2fb16a8e.svg) [Jacky Alciné](https://indieweb.org/User:Jacky.wtf "User:Jacky.wtf") 2021-03-22 08:35 AM PST:

Digital reading lists can be more rich than the conventional approach. Keeping track of when I paused on a book and to see when would be a good time to resurface it would be helpful (probably manually done). Also being able to see what other books my friends have kept on their lists could also help with getting back into them
