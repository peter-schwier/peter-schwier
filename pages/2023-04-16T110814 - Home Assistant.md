Home Assistant keeps your data local, no need for a cloud.

Home Assistant communicates with your devices locally, and will fallback to pulling in data from the cloud if there is no other option. No data is stored in the cloud, and everything is processed locally.

Use the official Home Assistant apps, a convenient companion to quickly control your devices and be notified when things happen in your home, even on your wrist using the Apple Watch.

The apps can also be used to send your location home to use presence detection as part of your automations. Data is sent directly to your home, no access by third-parties.
