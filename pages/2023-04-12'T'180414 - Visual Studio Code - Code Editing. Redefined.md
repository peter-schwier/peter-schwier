VS [@code](https://twitter.com/code) does so many things right. I‚Äôm constantly impressed by the UX, and customizing workspace / user preferences is no exception. üôåüèºüíØ It just keeps getting better ‚ù§Ô∏è

VS Code will have deep remote development. You can connect to a container running a different OS and use any VS Code plugins, linting, debugging for that environment. üî•üî•üî•

VS Code is my most used and favorite editor. I love being able to customize the editor - changing the layout, the icons, fonts and color scheme is so easy!

Just as I thought [@code](https://twitter.com/code) couldn't get better, out comes its Remote Development plugins that let you remote into containers as a dev environment! üòç

I was a vim fan, but then discovered VS Code's Vim plugin, which lets me add in my vim keybindings. I can maintain my coding style without having to compromise on speed.

I love [@code](https://twitter.com/code) The built-in markdown previewer is awesome and the plugin system allows me to use GitLens, which makes my workflow so much easier.

## Meet IntelliSense.

Go beyond syntax highlighting and autocomplete with IntelliSense, which provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules.

![Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/images/home-debug.svg)

## Print statement debugging is a thing of the past.

Debug code right from the editor. Launch or attach to your running apps and debug with break points, call stacks, and an interactive console.

![Git](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/images/home-git.svg)

## Git commands built-in.

Working with Git and other SCM providers has never been easier. Review diffs, stage files, and make commits right from the editor. Push and pull from any hosted SCM service.

## Extensible and customizable.

Want even more features? Install extensions to add new languages, themes, debuggers, and to connect to additional services. Extensions run in separate processes, ensuring they won't slow down your editor. [Learn more about extensions.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)
