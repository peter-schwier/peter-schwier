# Fleek: Build on the New Internet

## Excerpt
> Fleek is a suite of tools with everything you need to build modern sites and apps on the Open Web and its protocols seamlessly.

---
## New Internet

Fleek makes it easy to build websites and apps on the new open web: permissionless, trustless, censorship resistant, and free of centralized gatekeepers.

## Different Use Cases, Same Awesome Benefits.

All Fleek products are built on the underlying protocols that power the new Open Web (Internet Computer, IPFS, Textile, Filecoin. Ethereum). This allows you to enjoy the same awesome performance, resilience, trustlessness, and censorship-resistance benefits across all products and use cases. It’s easy to use, and low-code.

## The Full Suite of Tools for the Open Web.

We are building an open interface that will act as the base layer of web services needed to host and store on the Open Web, by combining and orchestrating protocols that power trustless, and decentralized alternatives to the current web’s centralized infrastructure services.

## Store & Fetch Files on IPFS.

## Fast as Fleek.

Use Fleek to upload, store & fetch files from IPFS in an easy to use, performant, and familiar way including UI, API and CLI interfaces. With S3 & Minio compatability, built in pinning orchestration, compression, image resizing, & global CDN, Fleek’s storage solution has everything you need built into one seamless product.

## Deploy to IPFS in Seconds

1\. Connect your repository

2\. Add your build settings

![][fig4]

No really its that simple.

## With Crypto & Credit Card Support.

Prepay using WBTC, USDC, DAI or ETH to our ENS address (fleekhq.eth), or link a credit card.

## Seamless ENS Domain Management

Don’t rely simply on DNS. With Fleek, you can seamlessly point your website or app to an ENS (Ethereum Name Service) decentralized domain name. We make it a seamless experience, updating the content hash automatically and abstracting fees.

## Archive Sites & Storage.

## Decentralized, in Filecoin.

Fleek automatically archives and backups your IPFS/Internet Computer hosted sites and apps, as well as your IPFS-stored files, to Filecoin. This will ensure you have a redundant backup layer existing on a decentralized storage network out of Fleek.

## Control the Fleek Hosting  
Suite With our CLI & API

Use our Hosting CLI to deploy from terminal, push sites from local machine, and other alternative workflows like custom GitHub Actions for deploys; and our GraphQL API for integrating and interacting with your Fleek-hosted sites, their data, and deployments.

## Works for almost all sites & popular frameworks

## What the Community is Saying

Deployed my old personal website to #IPFS using Fleek in < 10min. That was awesome, great work Fleek! 

juan.benet.ai finally has automatic SSL.    ![:raised_hands:][fig10] ![:lock:][fig11] ![:white_check_mark:][fig12]![:tada:][fig13]

Just started my journey to Web 3 and Decentralized Web. Blog is now hosted on IPFS, thanks to Fleek and their super smooth service.

Alessandro Baffa

Creating your own web3 site on IPFS is as easy as pointing Fleek at a github repo or just an html file!

Molly Mackinlay

Project Lead, IPFS

All those static files are currently sitting in GitHub and anytime I push an update from my local machine, it auto builds the new site files for me! Loving Fleek so far!
