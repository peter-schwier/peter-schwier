## The right idea session at the right time.

How do you know what tactic to run, and when?

You’ll always choose the right approach with the Idea Strategy System. A simple set of questions helps you find the most useful category of tactics.

It’s the perfect tool to help you plan your first session when you aren’t sure where to begin, or to get unstuck if you feel lost.

## Clear step-by-step instructions.

You need the concise steps to run the tactic - not someone’s life story.

Each exercise fits on the back of a card, so you can get started in minutes.

The jargon-free instructions are easy to follow, for novices and experts alike.

## Never get stuck when following up.

You've just finished a great session and someone asks “so what‘s next?”

The answer is on the bottom of each card.

Like a choose-your-own-adventure, it points to the suggested tactics to run before and after - so you never get stuck.

## Timeless content

The tactics are designed to stand the test of time. They are simple, yet effective.

## Repeatable process

Each deck contains a Strategy System that helps you get to the tactics you need, fast.

## The power of physical

Pip Decks are designed so that their physical qualities reflect the power of their contents.

It’s weighty. It’s big. It's smooth to touch. No detail has been overlooked.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When do I get the Digital Cards and access to The Vault?

The Digital Cards are emailed to you right after checkout, so you can get started right away without having to wait for your physical deck. The new deck content for The Vault is still in progress and will be released in the run up to the physical deck launch in December.

  

### Do you ship to my country?

We ship to the US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.

  

### You’re based in the UK - will there be customs charges on my order?

We have fulfilment centres in the US, UK or Europe. So if you are ordering within these zones - there is no customs charge. If you’re ordering outside of these zones (e.g. Australia) - customs charges should be minimal, if non-existant as we declare the cost price of the physical deck, not the full retail price of everything (The Vault + Digital Cards, etc).

  

### Do you do discounts for non-profits / educational institutions / students?

Yes! Get in touch at [sales@pipdecks.com](mailto:sales@pipdecks.com) with your credentials (non-profit status or student ID) and we will arrange a discount for you.

  

### Do you really have a 10x return on investment gurantee?

Yup. If within a year you have used the cards and video tutorials to a reasonable degree and you haven’t found the outcomes from using them are worth _at least_ 10x what you paid, we’ll refund you in full - and you can keep the deck.

  

### Can I get a VAT invoice?

Totally! You can provide your VAT number at checkout. And after making a purchase we will automatically email you a receipt. That email will include a link to generate a more detailed invoice that includes your company information and VAT.

  

### Will the Digital Cards work in the software I use?

The Digital Cards are compatible with: **Miro, MURAL, FigJam, PowerPoint, Jamboard, Whiteboard.** Pretty much any software that allows you to play images. The Pip Deck comes in three formats: The super-premium physical deck. A lightweight PDF. And JPG images of the front and back of each card. The images are organised in folders inside a .ZIP file so you can easily navigate to the right card.

  

### Can I upgrade to the Physical Deck package later?

Of course! Shoot us an email at [support@pipdecks.com](mailto:support@pipdecks.com) and we’ll sort you out.

  

### What if I decide it’s not for me?

No problem at all! Email us at [support@pipdecks.com](mailto:support@pipdecks.com) within 100 days and we’ll refund you in full, no questions asked.
