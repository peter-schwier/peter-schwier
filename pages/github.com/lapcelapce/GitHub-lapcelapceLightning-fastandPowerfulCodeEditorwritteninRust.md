#### Lightning-fast And Powerful Code Editor

 [![][fig2]](https://github.com/lapce/lapce/actions/workflows/ci.yml)[![][fig3] ](https://discord.gg/n8tGJ6Rn6D)[![][fig4] ](https://matrix.to/#/#lapce-editor:matrix.org)[![Lapce Docs][fig5]](https://docs.lapce.dev/)

Lapce (IPA: /lÃ¦ps/) is written in pure Rust with a UI in [Druid](https://github.com/linebender/druid) (which is also written in Rust). It is designed with [Rope Science](https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_00.html) from the [Xi-Editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor) which makes for lightning-fast computation, and leverages [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) for rendering. More information about the features of Lapce can be found on the [main website](https://lapce.dev/) and user documentation can be found on [GitBook](https://docs.lapce.dev/).

## Features

-   Built-in LSP ([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)) support to give you intelligent code features such as: completion, diagnostics and code actions
-   Modal editing support as first class citizen (Vim-like, and toggleable)
-   Built-in remote development support inspired by [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). Enjoy the benefits of a "local" experience, and seamlessly gain the full power of a remote system.
-   Plugins can be written in programming languages that can compile to the [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) format (C, Rust, [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/))
-   Built-in terminal, so you can execute commands in your workspace, without leaving Lapce.
