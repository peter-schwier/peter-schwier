# Authelia - The Single Sign-On Multi-Factor portal for web apps

> ## Excerpt
> Authelia is an open-source authentication and authorization server and portal fulfilling the identity and access management (IAM) role of information security in providing multi-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for your applications via a web portal. It acts as a companion for common reverse proxies.

## Lightweight 🪶

With a compressed container size smaller than 20 megabytes and observed memory usage normally under 30 megabytes, it's one of the most lightweight solutions available.

## Blazing Fast ⚡

Written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), authorization policies and many other backend tasks are completed in mere milliseconds and login portal loading times of 100 milliseconds makes it one of the fastest solutions available.

## Efficient ♻

Processors can use a lot of electricity, but when idle usage is basically so low that you can't measure it, and active usage in a small business environment being under 1% you can rest easy (with the exclusion of password hashing).

## Security by Design 🔒

Not just another IAM portal, [security](https://www.authelia.com/overview/security/introduction/) is heavily considered as part of our design process.

## Login Regulation 🛡️

Prevent brute force login attempts by only allowing a [certain number of logins](https://www.authelia.com/overview/authorization/regulation/) before the user is locked for a period.

## Password Reset 📧

In-built support for users to reset their LDAP or internal passwords with email validation right from the web interface.

## Single Sign-On 🎟️

Allow your users the convenience of just being required to login once to a wide range of web applications via a session cookie, [OpenID Connect 1.0](https://www.authelia.com/overview/authorization/openid-connect-1.0/), or [Trusted Headers](https://www.authelia.com/overview/authorization/trusted-headers/).

## Authorization Policies 👮

Control which users and groups have access to which specific resources or domains with incredibly [granular policy definitions](https://www.authelia.com/overview/authorization/access-control/).

## Identity Validation ✔

Users who have not configured a second-factor device are required to validate their identity via an email reducing the chance an attacker could exploit a lazy user.

## Scalability ⚙

Designed with high availability in mind, deployment options exist to easily allow multiple parallel containers on lifecycle management platforms like Kubernetes.

## Intuitive User Interface 💡

The login portal is super straight forward and the workflow is completely transparent to your users.
