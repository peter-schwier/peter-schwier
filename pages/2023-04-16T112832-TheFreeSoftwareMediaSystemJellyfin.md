Jellyfin is the volunteer-built media solution that puts _you_ in control of your media. Stream to any device from your own server, with no strings attached. Your media, your server, your way.

## What is Jellyfin?

Jellyfin enables you to collect, manage, and stream your media. Run the Jellyfin server on your system and gain access to the leading free-software entertainment system, bells _and_ whistles included.

## Your media, wherever you are

With a large array of official and third-party clients, Jellyfin is available on most popular platforms. Your media is ready to follow you, wherever you go.

### Free Software

Jellyfin is Free Software, licensed under the GNU GPL. You can use it, study it, modify it, build it, and distribute it for free, as long as your changes are licensed the same way.

### Community Built

The project relies entirely on contributions from volunteers. Want to help out? There’s lots of ways to do so, and you don’t even have to code! See our [contribution guide](https://jellyfin.org/contribute) for more details.

### No Fees

The Jellyfin server and official clients are free to download, now and always. There are no costs, hidden or otherwise, to use Jellyfin, either for yourself, for your friends, or for your company. All our incidental costs are paid through donations from users like you.

### Privacy Focused

Jellyfin has no tracking, phone-home, or central servers collecting your data. We believe in keeping our software open and transparent. We’re also not in the media business, so the only media you see is your own.
