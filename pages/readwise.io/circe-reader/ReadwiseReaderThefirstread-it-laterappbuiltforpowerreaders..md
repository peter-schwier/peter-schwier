The first¬† ¬†app

for power readers.

Save everything to one place, highlight like a pro, and replace several apps with Reader.

![The inbox][fig1] ![Mobile app][fig2]

## All your reading in one place.

No more juggling dozens of reading apps. Just one: we call it Reader.

### Web highlighting

Sometimes you need to highlight on the spot. Freely highlight and annotate the open web using the Reader browser extension.

### RSS

RSS is in a renaissance. Easily subscribe to the RSS feeds of your favorite websites in Reader to never miss a post.

### PDFs

Everyone has a forgotten folder of PDFs. Upload yours to Reader to finally integrate PDFs into your reading workflow.

### YouTube

YouTube has become one of the best learning platforms out there. Watch YouTube videos and highlight the transcript in Reader.

### Twitter threads

Twitter threads are the new blog posts. Compile hard-to-read threads into proper long-form articles inside Reader.

### Read-it-later

Most websites aren‚Äôt made for reading. Save articles to Reader for a distraction-free reading experience with powerful highlighting.

### EPUBs

Readwise was built on a foundation of ebook highlights. Upload EPUBs to Reader to enjoy ebooks alongside everything else.

### Newsletters

Newsletters connect you directly to your favorite writers. Subscribe to your newsletters in Reader to spare your email inbox.

## Powerful highlighting for power readers

Annotation should be the killer feature of digital reading. Instead, highlighting, tagging, & note-taking are neglected afterthoughts in other reading apps.

We believe that annotations are the key to getting more out of what you read. So we‚Äôve developed highlighting as a first-class feature. Highlight images, tables, rich text, and more. On any device.

Readwise has completely redesigned the read-it-later app. It‚Äôs gorgeous and blazingly fast. In many ways, it‚Äôs the Superhuman of reading ‚Äî you won‚Äôt want to read anywhere else.

The Readwise reading app is the first read-it-later app that enables a true workflow for serious readers. As an ex-Pocket / Instapaper power user, it's hard to imagine ever going back.

I've searched far and wide for the perfect reading app. Even though it‚Äôs still in beta, Reader has already replaced my previous read-it-later app. (And I always think twice about switching!)

## Reader will change the way you read

We've reinvented the digital reading experience to apply the power of software to the printed word.

### Keyboard-based reading

Glide through your documents without ever using the mouse. Keyboard-based reading enables you to navigate, highlight, and annotate with grace.

![ghostreader logo][fig11] ![ghostreader glasses][fig12]

### Ghostreader

Ghostreader is your GPT-3 copilot of reading. Ask questions. Define terms. Simplify complex language. And so much more.

![A search field][fig13]

### Blazingly fast full text¬†search

Find whatever you're looking for. Even if you only remember a single word. Even offline.

![text to speech][fig14]

### Text to speech

Listen to any document narrated with the lifelike voice of a real human.

### Upgrade your reading workflow.

### Eliminate multiple apps.

For web, iOS, and Android.

## Flexible software fits your unique needs

Your personal interests, your professional projects, your way of doing things ‚Äî they‚Äôre unique. Reader is your home base for the varied documents in your life, customizable to match the way your brain works.

PDFs for work, articles for your newsletter, and ebooks for pleasure all live comfortably side-by-side. No more juggling dozens of¬†apps.

## Integrated with your favorite tools

Your annotations should flow effortlessly from your reading app into your writing tool of choice. Instead you waste hours reformatting, reorganizing, and repeating. Reader eliminates this hassle.

Reader seamlessly connects to Readwise which exports to Obsidian, Notion, Roam Research, Evernote, Logseq, and more

Integrate with our public API

Reader is built API-first: roll your own solutions and integrate your tools using our API.

Easy consistent review with Readwise

Reader automatically syncs to Readwise: making it easy to revisit and learn from your highlights with Daily Review.

### Read anywhere, anytime

Access all of your content from any of your devices with everything in sync. Even offline. Reader syncs across a powerful, local-first web app, iOS app, and Android app. You can even highlight the open web with the Reader browser extensions.

Having tried every read-it-later app out there, I cried tears of joy once I got my hands on Reader. It's the smoothest experience to turn highlights into insights. Plus, I can finally highlight images!

Readwise is the reading, highlighting, archiving tool I've been long for: the Superhuman of reading. I was a top 1% Pocket user for many years and switched instantly.

Reader is the first reading app that helps you process information rather than hoard it. The keyboard nav and minimalist interface lead you into a deep flow state. A must for any knowledge worker!

I used to dump links into Pocket, but I never went back. Reader changes that. Now I feel on top of my reading. Plus the pace of execution of the Readwise team is insane.

Reader makes it easy to manage all the content coming at me. I'm no longer overwhelmed. Now I feel like I actually have enough time to read everything I want to.

Readwise is one of my favorite products of the last 5 years. Reader takes it to the next level. I no longer have to duct-tape together 7 different tools. Readwise just leapfrogged the status quo.

## Content overload, conquered.

Our read-it-later apps should improve over time. Instead, they worsen. Why? Because we save more stuff than we have time to deal with.

We fell in love with Superhuman‚Äôs fun, game-like triage for clearing our email inboxes of clutter. So we‚Äôve built the same for reading. Weed your digital garden with delight.

## Frequently asked questions

We're calling this release a ‚Äúpublic beta‚Äù because the surface area of the product is vast. We basically built five different kinds of reading apps at the same time without accidentally developing the software equivalent of a spork. Meanwhile, we had to make sure the app works well on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari as well as iOS and Android. We‚Äôre hoping the ‚Äúpublic beta‚Äù label buys us some leeway for the next few months while we hunt down new corner cases üôÇ

Once Reader officially exits beta sometime in 2023, we intend to reprice Readwise/Reader for new subscribers thereafter. Pricing is really hard and complex so we candidly haven't figured out the exact plans yet. But regardless, we don't intend to increase pricing on existing full subscribers at that time. This means that if you subscribe while Reader is in beta, you'll get lifetime access for $7.99/month (billed annually) as part of our current Readwise Full plan.

Yes! Reader is available on iOS and Android as well as a local-first web app. The entire experience is cross-platform meaning all data is continuously synced between all your devices. Please note that ‚Äúlocal-first web app‚Äù does not refer to a native app you install on your computer, but you can install the app as a Chrome app or with a Safari wrapper to get native-like experience.

Yes! You can import your existing read-it-later library from Instapaper, Pocket, and a handful of others. You can also import your existing RSS feeds from other feed readers using OPML.

Right now, you can think of Reader as another reading app that integrates with Readwise (albeit seamlessly because they share a database). Every highlight you make in Reader instantly syncs with Readwise and then from Readwise to your note-taking apps. Over time, the vision is to create a unified experience between Readwise and Reader within Reader. Regardless, if you have a Readwise Full plan, you get access to both apps.
