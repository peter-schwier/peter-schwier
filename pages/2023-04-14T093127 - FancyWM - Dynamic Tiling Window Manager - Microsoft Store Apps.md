## Excerpt
> FancyWM is a dynamic tiling window manager for Windows 10/11

☑ Create dynamic tiling layouts with mouse or keyboard
☑ Move window focus with keyboard
☑ Swap windows with keyboard
☑ Resize windows with keyboard
☑ Swap windows with mouse (hold [⇧ Shift] while dragging)
☑ Horizontal panels
☑ Vertical panels
☑ Stack panels (tabbed layouts)
☑ Panel embedding
☑ Jump to virtual desktop ([⇧ Shift] + [⊞ Win], then [1-9])
☑ Move focused window to virtual desktop ([⇧ Shift] + [⊞ Win], then [⇧ Shift] + [1-9])
☑ Floating window mode (via keybindings or rule-based)
☑ Auto-float windows which cannot fit
☑ Customizable keybindings
☑ Support for multiple monitors
☑ Support for virtual desktops
☑ Allows window maximization
☑ Low CPU usage (<1%)
☑ Disable animations for longer battery life
☑ Windows open in focused panel
☑ Remap activation hotkey to [⇧ Shift] + [⊞ Win], [Ctrl] + [⊞ Win] or [Alt] + [⊞ Win]

FancyWM uses [⇧ Shift] + [⊞ Win] as the start of a command sequence (Activation hotkey). To start a command sequence, press and release these keys simultaneously, then follow up by pressing one of the keybindings you have configured in the settings.

FancyWM only manages restored (not minimized, not maximized) top-level application windows, so it doesn't interfere with popups, and still allows you to use all of your available display area for when you need to focus on a window.

Issues
Please, take the time to report any problems you experience by:
• Opening an issue on https://github.com/veselink1/fancywm-issues/issues (feature requests also welcome)
In case of crashes, please also remember to save and attach the log file produced by the application.

## Best so far

It's not perfect, but compared to everything else I tried, it's worth keeping. I don't use the hotkeys much as it's too complicated on Windows. (I use i3 on Linux). The window tiling quirks took a bit getting used to like creating containers, getting rid of them … with the mouse. Once I mastered those, I've become more productive. FYI, This app dynamically tiles newly opened apps unlike FancyZone. I dislike the separate container floating bar. Groupy's container solution is more elegant. The app crashed once in 2 weeks of use (no big deal). The app did not nag much and the price is REASONABLE so I bought a license to support the developer. Good job author!

## Love it

This app is amazing and I would never want to use windows without it.

## Arthur

## Creator actively working on app. Best on market.

UPDATE: (Jul 16, 2022) The creator is currently working on the problems I have reported on their github, so I will bump it up to a 4/5. I believe they've already pushed out an update or two. -- Misbehaves when moving chrome tabs between windows, can't use other frames in conjunction with stacking frames, can't figure out how to re-enable management of a floating window without closing and re-opening it, Help section not very helpful (past the super basics), Rules section has no real explanation or examples of regular expressions (couldn't figure out how to append wildcards even with the help of google), and the use of the activation hotkey plus the default key combos could use some polishing. Still, it's the best I've seen so far with way more capabilities than anything else. But as a paid user, I feel like I paid for a beta software. Will definitely bump up my rating as the wrinkles get ironed out. Keep it up.
