## Excerpt
> A post-modern modal text editor.

---
## A post-modern **text editor**.

___

## Multiple selections

Multiple cursors as a core editing primitive, inspired by [Kakoune](http://kakoune.org/). Commands manipulate selections which allows concurrent code editing.

## [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) integration

Tree-sitter produces error tolerant and robust syntax trees, which enables better syntax highlighting, indent calculation and code navigation.

## Powerful code manipulation

[Navigate](https://docs.helix-editor.com/usage.html#tree-sitter-textobject-based-navigation) and [select](https://docs.helix-editor.com/usage.html#textobjects) functions, classes, comments, etc and select syntax tree nodes instead of plain text.

## [Language server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) support

Language specific auto completion, goto definition, documentation, diagnostics and other IDE features with no additional configuration.

## Built in Rust, for the terminal

No Electron. No VimScript. No JavaScript. Use it over ssh, tmux, or a plain terminal. Your laptop battery life will thank you.

## Modern builtin features

Fuzzy finder to jump to files and symbols, project wide search, [beautiful themes](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Themes), auto closing bracket pairs, [surround](https://docs.helix-editor.com/usage.html#surround) integration and more.

## **Frequent questions**

### Post-modern?!

It's a joke. If Neovim is the modern Vim, then Helix is post-modern.

### Is it any good?

[Yes.](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434)

### Are there plans for a GUI frontend?

Eventually, yes! We'd like to prototype a WebGPU-based alternative frontend. See the [tracking issue](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/39) on GitHub.

### What about plugins?

While there is currently no plugin system available, we do intend to eventually have one. But this will take some time ([more discussion here](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/discussions/3806)).

### How does it differ from Kakoune?

Mainly by having more things built-in. Kakoune is [composable by design](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/doc/design.asciidoc), relying on external tooling to manage splits and provide language server support. Helix instead chooses to integrate more. We also use tree-sitter for highlighting and code analysis.

### How does it differ from Vim?

By starting from scratch we were able to learn from our experience with Vim and make some breaking changes. The result is a much smaller codebase and a modern set of defaults. It's easier to get started if you've never used a modal editor before, and there's much less fiddling with config files.
