## What is this

My personal configs, carefully and passionately crafted for setting up an optimal CLI dev experience on the go.

Bootstraps `termux` with `oh-my-zsh`, custom `p10k` prompt, `neovim`, `tmux`, `ranger` & `powerline` fonts and a bunch of other useful CLI tools and configs.

## Inspiration

Wanting a super portable CLI dev setup.

## Setup

```shell
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/Oh-My-Termux
cd Oh-My-Termux

# Menu based interactive setup
./setup.sh

# Setup everythin unattended
./setup.sh -a
```

## Requirements

For installation `git` `curl` & `zsh` are must, other tools are mentioned below.

### Packages

This list is incomplete, package names may vary depending upon your system and your requirements.

```shell
# Required
git, zsh, neovim, tmux, git-delta, bat, fd, fzf, fasd, ag(silver_surfer), curl, powerline, lsd
# Optional
ranger, cmus, htop, python, vim, broot, bash, ncdu, grc, exa, xplr
```

Powerline patched fonts are required for glyphs. I'll recommend [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). I'm using FiraCode.

## How it was built

Oh-My-Termux was built using bits and pieces from my [Dotfiles](https://github.com/2kabhishek/Dotfiles), repurposed and tweaked to fit this use case

## Challenges faced

Finding workarounds for a few things on `termux` was a bit challenging.

## What I learned

I learned about writing good cross-platform bash scripts and learned a lot about making flexible configs and making them as easy to setup as possible.

## What's next

Planning to add more tools, better management, always updating.
