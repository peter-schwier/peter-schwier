Syncthing is a **continuous file synchronization** program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third party, and how itâ€™s transmitted over the internet.

## Get Started

Grab one of the [downloads](https://syncthing.net/downloads/) and start syncing!  
Check out the [getting started guide](https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html) for some tips along the way.
