## Our mission

___

### Taking back the net…

Redecentralize challenges the prevalent paradigm of central ‘clouds’ and ‘platforms’ that intermediate people’s interactions, set the rules, and lock them in.

We strive for an ecosystem of interoperable products, letting people choose their software and keep their data themselves.

Think self-hostable social media where users and communities can set their own rules; apps that don’t spy; devices that obey their user, not creator.

### …by supporting _decent_ tech

Redecentralize connects, facilitates and promotes projects pursuing decentralisation. We bring people together to learn and exchange, and help bridge the gap between technology, media and politics.

Amid growing awareness of problems with big tech, we advocate for structural solutions. Where others might debate how a powerful platform should be kept accountable, we question why it even has this power — and show the alternatives.
