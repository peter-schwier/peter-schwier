# 6 open source tools I use on my Windows machine | Opensource.com

## Excerpt
> These are Jimmy's six favorite open source applications that he immediately installs on a new Windows-based work computer.

---
In most of the places I have worked there has been a centralized computer and application standard that was more or less mandatory for all employees. There are benefits of such an environment, which I will not go into in this piece, but for me, as an open source and Linux enthusiast, I try to use the tools I'm used to and like.

So, I immediately install my favorite applications when I receive a new standardized Windows-based work computer, something I have been lucky enough to be allowed to do.

## Vim

The first application I install is [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). I can't live without it on any computer. I have tried other editors and word processors but nothing can compete with Vim. I tried using Microsoft OneNote but was not happy with the interface and the huge files it created. I transferred all my notes, more than 800MB, into [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files. All Markdown files, including pictures, occupied less than 800KB of storage. I call that a win. If all 14,000 users at my former workplace would do the same, we would have been able to save a lot of space and investment in storage. The Markdown files are also portable to all platforms and can easily be converted into other formats if needed.

## Pandoc

Next up is [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), which converts my Markdown notes into other formats, such as Microsoft Word or PDF. To convert to PDF, you will also need a [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) document preparation engine, which is next in line.

## MikTex

[MikTex](https://miktex.org/) is a LaTeX editor. I don't use it as an editor that much, but I need the LaTeX engine mentioned previously to be able to convert files into PDF files through Pandoc.

## VirtuaWin

Coming from a Linux environment I miss having multiple workspaces. Usually the companies I have worked for used Microsoft Windows 7 as the standard OS, which has no support for workspaces. [VirtuaWin](http://virtuawin.sourceforge.net/) to the rescue! After installation, you need to make some configurations for keyboard shortcuts, but after that, you're up and switching between workspaces in no time.

## KeePass

After working in IT business and for several years focusing on security I'm a big fan of complicated passwords. There are many reasons to [use a password manager](https://opensource.com/search/apachesolr_search/password%20manager), and I prefer [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) because I have used it for years and it works on all my different platforms. [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/) is another great alternative.

## GIMP

There are ways to do simple changes or edits to pictures in Windows, but to me, the easiest way is to fire up [GIMP](https://gimp.org/). It's suitable for small fixes up to major photo or picture editing. It is very powerful but still easy to understand, and it does simple things as well.

## An evolving favorites list

These are the tools I use now, and I have had other favorites, such as [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor, and [XChat](http://xchat.org/).

The best tools for office suites depend on the type of templates you're supposed to use and if you need to collaborate with colleagues using the same files. I used LibreOffice for years when I could create my own templates that follow the company's graphics profile, but when I collaborated with colleagues who were using Microsoft Word it just never worked out well with type settings and it made weird automatic changes to the layout.

The one application I have not been able to find any substitute for, which prevents me from going all open source, is Skype for Business. It is often a company-wide solution for chat, audio, and video conferences, and it is still hard to find an open source alternative. If you have a solution, let me know in the comments.
